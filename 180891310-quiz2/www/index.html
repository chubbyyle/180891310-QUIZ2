				<h3> Excitement on the bus </h3>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p> Tina finally finished all of her exams and wanted to treat herself to a hearty, delicious meal. She was thinking of places to go, googling best places to eat at. The first restaurant that popped up was her favourite store, Pho Rua Vang. She decided to go there and hopped on the bus. The whole time, all she could think about is what was waiting for her at the restaurant! </p>

				<h3> Issues </h3>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p> She calculated that within 30 minutes, she would arrive at her destination. However, upruptly..a huge problem occured. The bus BROKE DOWN and the bus driver told the passengers that everyone would need to wait until the next bus comes, which would take an extra hour. All Tine could do was sigh and wait. She could not believe that this would happen to her. </p>

				<h1> The Happy Ending </h1>

				<h3> End of The Journey </h3>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p> Suddenly, a mircale came through! She had a phone call and guess what? Her older sister, Lina, was around the area and asked her if she needed a ride. After the call, she was happily and exicted that she would get to eat very soon. Once her sister picked her up and dropped off at the store. She rushed to order her meal and some time later, a delicious bowl of pho was right in front of her eyes. That was the only ending a girl needs. Her pho. </p>
